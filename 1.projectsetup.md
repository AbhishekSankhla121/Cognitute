## 1. Basic Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

* Git
* GitHub
* Docker
* Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhishekSankhla121/Cognitute.git
cd Cognitute
```

## 2. VS Code Extension Requirement

Install the **Dev Containers** extension in VS Code.

> ⚠️ This is the most important extension for this project.

## 3. Rebuild Dev Container

1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or use the search menu at the top).
3. Type and select:

```
Dev Containers: Rebuild Container Without Cache
```

4. Press **Enter** to rebuild the container.

---

## 4. Install Node Modules

Open the terminal inside the container and run:

```bash
npm install
# or
npm ci
```

> **Note:** This project uses Google authentication. To log in, you need to add your primary Google email addresses in the seed file. Please refer to the "projectSetupVideo". You should add **two Google addresses** so users can sign up with Google.

## 5. Database Setup

Run the following commands to set up your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
# or
npx prisma db seed
```

This will reset the database and populate it with the seed data.

## 6. Run the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The project should now be running locally at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
